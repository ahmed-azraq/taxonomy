      Hybrid by design delivers impressive results. IBM is on its way to $3
      billion in productivity improvements using hybrid by design. Argentina’s
      Ministry of Health responded to a 1500% increase in transaction volume
      during the pandemic using hybrid by design. And Delta’s cloud
      transformation initiatives are helping the airline make its way better
      employee engagement, productivity, speed to market, and cost efficiencies

      Hybrid by design is a tested, codified architectural framework, running on
      hybrid cloud, to help organizations optimize business value through
      technology. It’s a structure that will support their business moving
      forward, giving them the agility, speed, and integration they need to
      achieve their future business outcomes. Hybrid by design began in cloud
      architecture. It described how some organizations designed their hybrid
      cloud estates—deliberately, through the lens of business priorities. These
      enterprises used a mix of public and private clouds, as well as
      on-premises data centers, to help them gain agility and speed, and scale
      business initiatives. Today, as generative AI invades businesses, the
      principles behind hybrid by design apply beyond cloud computing to the
      enterprise as a whole: platforms, security, AI, cloud, data—the entire
      technology estate. Hybrid by design can turn a cacophony of disparate
      technologies into a symphony—amplifying business outcomes through wise
      design and integration.

      Delta mapped the migration that would move all of the airline’s
      distributed workloads to the hybrid cloud. By modernizing operations with
      an open hybrid-cloud architecture, Delta can now deploy anywhere and take
      a consistent, standards-based approach to development, security, and
      operations across clouds.

      The outcome

      Hundreds of applications have been migrated to the cloud. Delta and its
      customers are already reaping some of the rewards such as free in-flight
      Wi-Fi on more than 680 planes. The airline’s cloud transformation
      initiatives aims to increase employee engagement, productivity, speed to
      market, and cost efficiencies by between 25%—30%.

      The challenge

      Patients in Argentina often have a primary hospital for the majority of
      medical needs but also use other health facilities. Or they shuffle
      between private practices and public hospitals for tests. Because of this,
      Argentina’s Ministry of Health wanted to automate the flow of public
      health statistics and the management of underlying systems.

      The solution

      Moving beyond its slow legacy solutions and monolithic applications, AMoH
      built a national digital health network. The ministry established a
      flexible yet stable IT infrastructure with a Red Hat® technology
      foundation, allowing centers to securely access patient data through
      standardized integration between providers.

      The outcome

      The new digital health network allowed AMoH to respond to a 1500% increase
      in transaction volume during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also allowed the
      institution to manage universal electronic records, enabling a quick
      response to any increase in transaction volume, while also allowing the
      addition of new services and features.

      IBM created an Enterprise Performance Management (EPM) platform as the
      trusted source of integrated enterprise data and a catalyst for faster
      decision-making. Based on one enterprise data model, EPM integrates data
      from all trusted enterprise sources across geographies and business units,
      breaking down historical data silos. EPM standardizes KPIs and aligns data
      to enterprise data standards to deliver interactive dashboards and a
      culture of working “on the glass.” This leads to more proactive analysis
      and action, driving IBM’s growth and enterprise productivity. EPM delivers
      trusted business insights and analytics from across the enterprise. Built
      on one unified data model, the platform brings together insights from
      marketing, sales, finance, operations, human resources, and supply chain.
